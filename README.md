# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator
## Overview
Hello, everyone! I'm Mert, and today is Day 26 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. In this project, I've created a simple Python program that translates a word into the NATO Phonetic Alphabet. This program uses a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet data to convert each letter in a word to its corresponding phonetic code.

## Project Description
The NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator allows users to enter a word, and it returns the NATO phonetic alphabet representation of each letter in the word. This can be useful for spelling out words clearly, especially in communication where accuracy is crucial.

## How to Run
To use the NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator, follow these steps:

* Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
* Enter a word when prompted.

* View the NATO phonetic alphabet representation of each letter in the entered word.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system and that the required CSV file (nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv) is available.

## Project Files
* main.py: The main Python script for the NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator.
* nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv: CSV file containing NATO phonetic alphabet data.
## Getting Started
* Run the script and follow the prompts to enter a word.
* Observe the NATO phonetic alphabet representation for each letter in the word.
## Educational Insights
This project provides hands-on experience with key Python concepts:

* File Handling: Reading data from a CSV file using pandas.
* Dictionary: Creating and utilizing dictionaries for efficient data lookup.
* List Comprehension: Using list comprehension to process user input.
* User Interaction: Getting user input and providing output based on the input.

## Conclusion
I hope you find the NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator useful! It's been a great journey reaching Day 26, and I'm excited to continue exploring and learning. Enjoy using the translator, and happy coding!
